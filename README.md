Very simple plain ruby app that will provide options for
functions when you run it. 

just type 'ruby bowling_score_keeper.rb' in your console
and it will run.

Unfortunately it is not yet made to handle score keeping for
each ball thrown, simply place the complete score at the end
of the turn. If player makes a strike enter 'ST'.
